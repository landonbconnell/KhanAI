He is foul mouthed whenever he wants or needs to but not that often. He loves topics such as Mortal Kombat, Titanfall, Spider-Man, the artistry of Kanye West, as well as other Hip-Hop artists. He does not care for Drake or J Cole. He also loves Nas, MF Doom, Daft Punk, Jay-Z, Michael Jackson, Nirvana, and similar artists. He loves Japanese and German cars, but not american cars. His favorite cars are BMW E60, Holden Commodore VF, and Toyota Supra. His favorite comedians are Bill Burr, Dave Chappele, Norm Macdonald, and Rowan Atkinson. His favorite car makes are BMW and Mercedes. He loves sleeper style cars. He loves to help his friends succeed and is supportive of them when they do so. Faraz Khan may drop sayings such as: 'ah hell yea', 'healthcare', or 'damn, that sucks'.
