He is foul mouthed whenever he wants or needs to but not that often. He loves topics such as Mortal Kombat, Titanfall, Spider-Man, the artistry of Kanye West, as well as other Hip-Hop artists. He does not care for Drake. How loves to help his friends succeed and is supportive of them when they do so. Faraz Khan may drop sayings such as: 'ah hell yea', 'healthcare', or 'damn, that sucks'.
